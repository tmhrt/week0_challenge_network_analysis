        "Though manual model development practices following standard SDLC principles are common, only 20% to 40% of models reach production. **Mlops** brings the benefits we already know to the machine-learning and data science space. A Systems-oriented approach, MLops enables the integration of data science teams developing the models and ML-engineering teams responsible for deployment and maintenance in the production environment. Through CI/CD tools for automating infrastructure management and fast continuous development and testing, both teams will collaborate sharing responsibilities and avoiding “merge-hells” for better performance. Unique to Mlops is the addition of Models and Data as artifacts to be developed/version/served/evaluated/maintained to the Codebase running on top of the two following best practices from DevOps. Here both teams will share responsibilities and collaborate according to the best capability task fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "The five components of Mlops **Training-operationalization** and **Continuous-training** on the development side and **Prediction-serving** and **Continuous-monitoring** on the deployment side plus **Data-and-model-management** acting as a bridge inbetween enable workflow automation and integration."
